Dear Hiring Manager,

I am excited to apply for the Data Scientist position at Coinbase, driven by your mission to increase economic freedom and the transformative potential of crypto and blockchain technology. With my extensive experience in data analysis, process automation, and a strong passion for decentralized finance, I am eager to contribute my expertise and embrace the challenge of building the future global financial system.

As a seasoned data professional with a Bachelor of Applied Science in Computer Science from Austin Community College and over two years of experience, I have a proven ability to leverage data-driven insights to drive impact. During my tenure at Costco, I developed complex Excel spreadsheets, automated processes with macros, and implemented Business Intelligence (BI) solutions to streamline reporting. These efforts improved data accessibility and provided actionable insights for management. Additionally, I led an analytics project that involved designing A/B tests to optimize processes, resulting in significant time savings.

At Coinbase, I look forward to pushing the boundaries of what I’m capable of and working alongside high-caliber colleagues who share a passion for building the future of financial systems. I thrive in environments where continuous learning and growth are paramount, and I actively seek out feedback to elevate my performance. Your commitment to innovation and excellence aligns perfectly with my professional ethos.

**Highlights of my qualifications include:**

- **Statistical Expertise & Experimentation:** Proficient in designing and analyzing experiments (A/B testing, causal inference) to measure impact, make strategic decisions, and improve product performance.
- **Data Analysis & Infrastructure:** Advanced proficiency in SQL, Python, Tableau, and Excel for data manipulation, modeling, and visualization. I have built and maintained dashboards that track critical metrics and supported payroll management using Workforce Central and SAP.
- **Process Automation & Technical Support:** Automated complex workflows with Excel macros and provided technical support to colleagues, resolving issues efficiently.
- **Clear Communication & Collaboration:** Known for clear and effective communication of data-driven insights to cross-functional teams, driving strategic initiatives forward.

Coinbase’s ambition to build the onchain platform and foster economic freedom excites me deeply. I am inspired by the opportunity to tackle the toughest challenges and make meaningful contributions to a company that is shaping the future of finance. I am ready to bring my passion for data science and relentless drive to your dynamic team.

Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm align with your vision.

Sincerely,  
Laura Sunley
